[![Artifact HUB](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://artifacthub.io/badge/repository/vineyard)](https://artifacthub.io/packages/helm/vineyard/vineyard-operator)

A helm chart for [vineyard operator][3], which manages all relavant components about vineyard.

## Install

Vineyard operator has been integrated with [Helm](https://helm.sh/). Add the vineyard repository to your Helm client:

```shell
$ helm repo add vineyard https://vineyard.oss-ap-southeast-1.aliyuncs.com/charts/
$ helm repo update
```

Refer to the [helm repo](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_repo/) for more repo information.

The webhook is enabled by default, please make sure you have the [Cert-Manager](https://cert-manager.io/docs/installation/) 
installed, then deploy it in the `default` namespace as follows:

```shell
$ helm install vineyard-operator vineyard/vineyard-operator
```

If you want to deploy it in a specific namespace, you can use the `--namespace` option:

```shell
$ helm install vineyard-operator vineyard/vineyard-operator \
      --namespace vineyard-system
```

If you want to set the value of the chart, you can use the `--set` option:

```shell
$ helm install vineyard-operator vineyard/vineyard-operator \
      --set image.tag=v0.10.1
```

Refer to the [helm install](https://helm.sh/docs/helm/helm_install/) for more command information.

Install `vineyardd` as follows.

```shell

$ cat <<EOF | kubectl apply -f -
apiVersion: k8s.v6d.io/v1alpha1
kind: Vineyardd
metadata:
  name: vineyardd-sample
spec:
  image: vineyardcloudnative/vineyardd:latest
  replicas: 3
  imagePullPolicy: IfNotPresent
  etcd:

```
